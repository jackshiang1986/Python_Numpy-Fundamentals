# Python_Numpy Fundamentals

Numpy is a linear algebra library in Python. It is so important for data science as many libraries (eg. pandas) are built on top of it and rely Numpy as one of their main building blocks. Numpy is incredibly fast and good for mathematical operations involving vectors, matrices etc. In this repository some codes for basic numpy operations are provided.

The following document is provided in this repository:
